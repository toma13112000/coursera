It will help people make wise and effective decisions to choose high-quality neighborhoods from the many other Torrento Scarborough neighborhoods. \n Many people are migrating to various states in Canada, and a lot of research is needed to get good home prices and provide well-known schools for your children. This project is suitable for those looking for a better community. For easy access to cafes, schools, supermarkets, medical stores, grocery stores, shopping malls, theaters, hospitals, like-minded people, etc. \n This project aims to create a characteristic analysis for people migrating to Scarborough, to search for the best community as a comparative analysis between communities. These characteristics include moderate home prices and better schools, based on ratings, crime rates in that particular area, road connectivity, weather conditions, good emergency management, fresh water and wastewater, and resources. water for faeces transported in sewers and recreational facilities. \n It will help people understand the region and community before moving to a new city, state, country or place to work or start a new life.\n \n## Problem Which Tried to Solve:\n\nThe main purpose of the project is to recommend a better community for people who move to a new city. As far as like-minded people are concerned, social existence in society. Connected to the airport, bus station, city center, market and other daily necessities nearby.\n\n1. Sorted list of house in terms of housing prices in a ascending or descending order\n2. Sorted list of schools in terms of location, fees, rating and reviews\n\n## The Location:\n\nScarborough is a popular place for new Canadian immigrants to live. As a result, it is one of the most diverse and multicultural areas of the Greater Toronto Area, with various religious groups and places of worship. Immigrants have been a hot topic in the last few years with more governments seeking more restrictions for immigrants and refugees, but the general immigration trend in Canada is increasing .\n\n## Foursquare API:\n\nThe project will use the Foursquare API as its main source of data collection because it has a database of millions of locations, especially the Places API, which provides the ability to perform location searches, share locations and business details.\n\n## Work Flow:\n\nCredentials will be extracted to use the Foursquare API function in locations close to the community. Due to http request restrictions, the number of positions for each neighborhood parameter will reasonably be set to 100 and the radius parameter will be set to 500.\n\n## Clustering Approach:\n\nTo compare the similarities between the two cities, we decided to explore the neighborhoods, divide them, and then group them together to find similar neighborhoods in large cities like New York and Toronto. In order to do this, we need to group the data, which is a form of unsupervised machine learning: kmeans grouping algorithm.\n\n## Libraries Which are Used to Develope the Project:\n\nPandas: For creating and manipulating dataframes.\nFolium: Python visualization library would be used to visualize the neighborhoods cluster distribution of using interactive leaflet map.\nScikit Learn: For importing k-means clustering.\nJSON: Library to handle JSON files.\nXML: To separate data from presentation and XML stores data in plain text format.\nGeocoder: To retrieve Location Data.\nBeautiful Soup and Requests: To scrap and library to handle http requests.\nMatplotlib: Python Plotting Module."}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.7", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.7.10", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
